    <h2><b>OBJECTIVE</b></h2>
    <p>It is my ambition to work with a time-paced organization where
        <br> 
       turn-around time is of paramount importance: that’s meeting/exceeding
       <br> 
       customer’s expectations. A new challenging experience, roles, 
       <br>
       responsibilities are germane while learning and developing more
       <br>
       skills at the same time. I’m driven by a well-defined structure with measurable 
       <br>
       missions that set employees on the path of competition for the company’s vision 
       <br>
       attainment. Becoming a senior decision maker within few years of service through hard
       <br>
       works and dedication resonates in me and if you seek an ambitious target-driven candidate,
       <br>
       I’m available!
